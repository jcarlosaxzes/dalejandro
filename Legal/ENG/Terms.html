    <h1>PASconcept Terms and Conditions</h1>
    <p>
        Welcome to PASconcept, the new Concept to Provide Project Administration Services online..<br>
        THIS LEGAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN YOU AND AXZES, LLC. (“Axzes”),  GOVERNS YOUR USE OF THE PASconcept SOFTWARE, SERVICES, AND WEBSITES (COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS THE “SERVICE”). IT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOU READ AND UNDERSTAND THE FOLLOWING TERMS AND CONDITIONS. BY CLICKING "AGREE," YOU ARE AGREEING THAT THESE TERMS WILL APPLY IF YOU CHOOSE TO ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICE.<br>
        Axzes is the provider and entity which owns the copyright of the software PASconcept and its services, which permits you to utilize certain Internet services, including but not limited to,  storing your personal content and making it accessible on your compatible devices, computers and certain location based services. To use the Service, you cannot be a person barred from receiving the Service under the laws of the United States or other applicable jurisdictions, including the country in which you reside or from where you use the Service. You consent and agree that Axzes may maintain information related to your account, including technical or diagnostic information related to your use that may be used by Axzes to support, improve and enhance PASconcept’s services.  By accepting this Agreement, you represent that you understand and agree to the foregoing Terms and Conditions.
    </p>
    <h2>Security Policy</h2>
    <p>
        Site Certificate Information. PASconcept understands that the security of your personal and business information is very important to you. When a user submits business and/or personal information and documents to and from PASconcept.com, the process is done through our secure servers. The pasconcept.com service allows only secure browsers to access the system. The browser's "secure mode" is in place only when the user is logged into the system. The user will notice that they are in a secure mode when their browser displays a special icon on the lower bar of their browser window. Every secure page (i.e. every part of the user interface) on pasconcept.com has been secured with a digital certificate by VeriSign, Inc., or a VeriSign partner. This is shown via the “Site Certificate” that is present on all secure pages. To view this certificate, click on the image on the closed lock on the bottom bar of your browser window. A small frame displaying the site security information will appear. This allows the user to verify the site certification authority and shows that the user is on projectplace.com or a sub-domain of projectplace.com, e.g. uk.projectplace.com. PASconcept is secured with a GoDaddy.com Web Server Certificate to enhance the security and protection of its users.  Transactions on the site are protected with up to 256-bit Secure Sockets Layer (“SSL”) encryption. SSL is the standard security technology for establishing an encrypted link between a web server and a browser. This link ensures that all data passed between the web server and browsers remain private and integral. SSL is an industry standard and is used by millions of websites in the protection of their online transactions.
        If your password is not working for any reason, you can re-establish your identity with the system as follows:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Go to <a href="http://www.pasconcept.com">http://www.pasconcept.com</a></li>
        <li>Enter your registered email address in the form and click “Request new password”.</li>
        <li>Follow the instructions in the e-mail message that will be sent to you</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        A password system has been established to ensure that only the User can access his or her personal information and project places. The required minimum password length is 6 characters. We recommend that you use a random combination of letters, numbers and capital letters to provide added protection and security (Example: 'Hfg678jk' would be a good password).<br>
        Each time you login to the system you will be required to authenticate your identity by entering your previously supplied e-mail address and password. Upon a successful login, you are issued a unique "session ID" (does not include any personal    identifiable information) which allows you to remain active so long as actions are performed in the system in thirty minute intervals, any further actions require you to re-enter your e-mail address and password.. If an incorrect password is supplied, or if you simply forget your password, you may need to re-establish your identity following the instructions set out above. After an undisclosed number of unsuccessful login attempts, you will be locked out.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Protection of Transmitted Information.</b> We use encryption technology to ensure the safe transmission of your information and documents when logged into the system. Your browser provides security by allowing us to use SSL encryption as far as 128-bit key length encryption when transmitting information and documents. The number of bits of secret key length varies between 40 and 128 depending on your browser’s capability. The highest available bit length is always used. All communication between your computer and pasconcept.com is encrypted using SSL.
    </p>
    <p><b>Protection of Stored Information.</b> PASconcept takes numerous measures to protect a client’s information which includes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Utilizing a firewall to protect our server farm and stored information. A firewall is a barrier to unauthorized users to prevent access to our systems.</li>
        <li>Monitoring system and application activity logs to identify any unusual activity, from authorized and/or unauthorized individuals accessing our systems and/or making changes to stored information for investigation.</li>
        <li>Housing the server farm in a highly secure building to provide additional protection against unauthorized access and changes to stored information.</li>
        <li>All documents stored at pasconcept.com are automatically encrypted with a unique key and saved anonymously in a secure database so that they cannot be identified for the purpose of barring the information to anyone, even those with administrative rights.</li>
        <li>The system administration at pasconcept.com has no functions allowing access to a client’s project place. It is thus impossible for employees at PASconcept without administrative privileges to access client documents.</li>

        <li>All employees at PASconcept without administrative privileges are bound by a confidentiality and non-disclosure agreement, which prohibits access to and disseminates information handled by the company’s clients when using the pasconcept.com web service.</li>
    </ul>

        <li>A complete backup is performed on a weekly basis.</li>
        <li>The backup medium is transferred at regular intervals (once a week) to an off-site long-term storage facility.</li>

    <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p><b>Privacy Statement.</b> Axzes has created this Privacy Statement to demonstrate PASconcept’s commitment to privacy and protection for its users. Further, Axzes takes all reasonable steps to help protect your personal information in an effort to prevent loss, misuse,  unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and/or destruction.  The following discloses how the information is gathered and disseminated.</p>
    <p><b>Personal Information and Sharing.</b> For every visit to PASconcept’s login page, the IP address, web browser and domain are automatically recognized. This information is not used to personally identify the user. Axzes uses the IP address to help diagnose possible problems with our server farm and internet connection. Axzes does not sell or market this information to any third party. Periodically however, Axzes aggregates this information internally and analyzes it to help improve and advance the performance of the services. During the registration/sign-in process, the new PASconcept administrator provides personally identifiable information such as name, email address, etc. This information is used primarily to identify the new PASconcept user in our service, which is required for the login process. The individual user account is based on email addresses and passwords. Users may opt –out of receiving emails and other promotional material. Refer to the Opt-out section described below. Axzes reserves the right to use the registered information of PASconcept’s users for Customer Relation Management (“CRM”), unless the user chooses to opt-out. Once the PASconcept administrator user is logged in, personal information such as name, title, company or organization, postal address, phone and fax number, etc. This information is shared only with the users the administrator chose to share within a project, and is also visible by Axzes in the user account profile. Axzes does not share, sell or market this information with any third party. Throughout the registration process, the personal information provided is used primarily for billing purposes and to contact the User in the event that there is a problem arising from the account.
