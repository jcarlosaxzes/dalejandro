    <td bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><h1><strong>Privacy Statement (pasconcept.com)</strong></h1>
    <p>PASconcept International AB  (hereinafter referred to as &quot;PASconcept&quot;) has created this Privacy  Statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following  discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices.<br>
      </p>
    <p><strong>Personal information and Information sharing</strong><br>
      For each visit to our login  page we automatically recognize your IP address, domain and Web browser. This  information is not used to personally identify you. We use your IP address to  help diagnose possible problems with our server farm and Internet connection.  We do not sell or market this information to any third party. We do however, on  occasion, aggregate this information internally and analyse it to help improve  the performance of our service. <br>
      During the  registration/sign-up process, you provide us with personally identifiable  information such as name, email address, etc. This information is used  primarily to identify you in our service, which is necessary for the login  process. The individual user account is based on e-mail addresses. We do not  share this information with anyone, nor do we sell or market this information  to any third party. Users may opt-out of receiving mailings and other  promotional material; see the choice/opt-out section below. PASconcept  reserves the right to use the registered information for CRM, sales and  marketing activities unless the user has chosen to opt-out. <br>
      Once you are logged in to the  service you may enter personal information in your preferences, such as name,  title, company or organization, postal address, phone and fax numbers, etc.  This information is only shared with the people you choose to share it with  within a project and is visible to us on your user account. We do not share  this information with anyone, nor do we sell or market this information to any  third party.<br>
      In the purchase process, you  provide us with personally identifiable information such as name, email  address, postal address and phone number, etc. This information is used primarily  for billing purposes, and to contact you in the case that a problem should  occur with your account. This information is shared in discretion and under  nondisclosure agreements with our billing partners, which is necessary since we  have chosen to outsource invoicing, collection of receivables and credit card  payments to partners. We do not market or sell this information to any third  party and the partners of PASconcept will under no circumstances contact the  users registered in our system for their own purposes. The information is  collected and owned by PASconcept only.<br>
      It is clearly indicated on our  web sites if information is optional or mandatory. By registering optional  information the user may benefit e.g. by receiving additional user guidelines and  manuals via post, or faster support reply via telephone, mobile phone or fax. <br>
      Our service contains links to  other sites. PASconcept International AB is not responsible for the privacy  practices or the content of such Web sites. <br>
    </p>
    <p><strong>Cookies</strong><br>
      We use cookies to save your  email address and language preference so you don't have to re-enter it each  time you visit our service. Cookies are also used for the duration you are  logged in to store session information. Please note that our service requires  the use of cookies for the login procedure, so you cannot use the service if  you set your browser to reject cookies. <br>
    </p>
    <p><strong>Security</strong><br>
      We recognize the importance  our customers place on security. We exercise great care to see to that any  information you enter or upload to your account is handled in a secure manner.  Therefore, all communication between your computer and our servers is encrypted  using SSL encryption technology. Furthermore, any document you upload to your  account is securely transmitted (using SSL) and is then stored in an encrypted  format.<br>
      This service has security  measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information  under our control. Internally, we restrict access to personally identifiable  information to employees who need access to the information to do their job.  All employees have to execute comprehensive nondisclosure agreements with us.  Employees are not allowed to access your project data or uploaded documents. In  fact, our extensive encryption procedures effectively prevents anyone  (including our employees) to access this information. This information can only  be accessed by the people you choose to share it with within a project. Backups  of user and project data are scheduled on a regular basis and these backups are  stored encrypted and safely locked up. For further information on the security  of pasconcept.com we refer to our <a href="Security.htm">Security policy</a>. <br>
