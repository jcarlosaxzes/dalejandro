    <td bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><h1><strong>Security Policy (pasconcept.com)</strong></h1>
    <p>PASconcept International AB  (hereinafter referred to as &quot;PASconcept&quot;) has created this Security  Policy in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to security. The following  discloses our security and accessibility policies.</p>
<p><strong>Site certificate information</strong><br>
PASconcept understands that  the security of your personal information and business details is important to  you. Whenever you submit personally identifiable or business identifiable  information or transfer other information and documents to and from pasconcept.com,  you will be doing so through our secure servers.<br>
The pasconcept.com service  only allows secure browsers access to the system. The browser's &quot;secure  mode&quot; is in place only when you are logged in to the system. You will be  able to tell that you are in a secure mode when your browser displays a special  icon on the lower bar of your browser window.<br>
Every secure page (i.e. every  part of the user interface) on pasconcept.com has been secured with a digital  certificate by VeriSign, Inc. or a VeriSign partner. This is shown via the  “site certificate” that is resident on all secure pages. To view this  certificate, click on the image of the closed lock on the bottom bar of your  browser window. A small frame displaying site security information will appear.  This allows you to verify the site certification authority and that you are in  fact on projectplace.com or a sub-domain of projectplace.com, e.g.  uk.projectplace.com.<br>
<strong>User identification</strong><br>
Only the members of a project  place can see the project place and access its contents. Each user selects  his/her own password for pasconcept.com. The users’ passwords are stored in a  one-way encrypted format and are not accessible to employees of PASconcept.<br>
After entering the required  registration information as a new user you will be able to access your user  account immediately. The password is chosen directly as part of the  registration process and not sent to you by any other means.<br>
If you have forgotten your  password, or your password is not working for some reason, you can re-establish  your identity with the system as follows:</p>
<ol start="1" type="1">
  <li>
    <p>Go to <a href="https://projectplace.com/swedish/loginhelp.htm" target="_blank">http://www.pasconcept.com</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Enter your registered       e-mail address in the form and click “Request new password”. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Follow the instructions       in the e-mail message that is sent to you (after step 2). </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>A password system has been  established to ensure that only you can access your personal information and  project places. The acceptable minimum password length is&nbsp;6 characters.  We&nbsp;recommend that you use a random combination of letters, numbers, and  cases to provide added protection (for instance: 'Hfg358mz' would be a good  password).<br>
  Each time you login to the  system you will be required to authenticate your identity by entering your  previously supplied e-mail address and password. Upon successful login, you are  issued a unique &quot;session id&quot; (does not include any personally  identifiable information) which allows you to remain active as long as actions  are performed in the system at least once every 30 minutes, after which any further  actions require you to re-enter your e-mail address and password. If an  incorrect password is supplied, or if you simply forget your password, you may  need to re-establish your identity following the instructions above.<br>
  After an undisclosed number of  unsuccessful login attempts, you will be locked out.<br>
  <strong>Protection of information being transmitted</strong><br>
  We use encryption technology  to ensure the safe transmission of your information and documents when logged  into the system. Your browser provides security by allowing us to use Secure  Socket Layer (SSL) encryption up to 128-bit key length encryption when  transmitting information and documents. The number of bits of secret key length  varies between 40 and 128 depending on your browser’s capability. The highest available  bit length is always used. All communication between your computer and pasconcept.com  is encrypted using SSL.<br>
  </p>
<p><strong>Protection of stored information</strong><br>
  PASconcept takes many  measures to protect client information while it is stored, including:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>
    <p>Utilizing a firewall to       protect our server farm and stored information. A firewall is a barrier to       unauthorized users to prevent access to our systems. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Monitoring system and       application activity logs to identify any unusual activity, from       authorized and/or unauthorized individuals accessing our systems and/or       making changes to stored information, for investigation. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Housing the server farm       in a highly secure building to provide additional protection against       unauthorized access and changes to stored information. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All documents stored at pasconcept.com       are automatically encrypted with a unique key and saved anonymously in a       secure database so that they cannot be identified. This means that not       even persons with administrative rights to the servers’ operating system       can access documents at pasconcept.com. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The system administration       at pasconcept.com has no functions allowing access to a client’s project       place. It is thus impossible for employees at PASconcept to access       clients’ documents. PASconcept has also taken special steps to ensure       that only a few key people are aware of how the security system is       designed and implemented. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All employees at PAS       Concept are bound by a confidentiality and non-disclosure agreement       prohibiting access to and dissemination of information handled by the       company’s clients when using the pasconcept.com Web service. </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to client data,  some personal information is stored in our databases and in browser cookies.  For a complete list of what personal and demographic information is stored at pasconcept.com  we refer to our <a href="Privacity.htm">Privacy Statement</a>.<br>
  </p>
<p><strong>Internet connection and server architecture</strong><br>
  The pasconcept.com server farm  consists of a range of redundant hardware components including: </p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>
    <p>Large bandwidth redundant       Internet connections to one of the main Internet connection points and       redundant routers with fail-over configuration. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Redundant firewalls with       filters and fail-over configuration. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Application and Web       servers in the form of several load-balanced multi-processor servers. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Redundant       database cluster configuration. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Database server mirrored       in a fail-over server, which will take over if the main server is interrupted. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>LAN with redundant       network switches and fail-over configuration. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Highly secure computer       facilities with cooling systems, UPS, backup systems and fire protection. </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Backup routines</strong><br>
  PASconcept has implemented  the following backup routines: </p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>
    <p>The database servers’       RAID- system is mirrored every five minutes. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All       backups are encrypted. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A differential backup       that saves changes made to files over the last 24 hours is performed every       day. The backup is made on alternating tapes so as to prevent faults       arising in them. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A complete backup is       performed weekly. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The backup medium is       transferred at regular intervals (once a week)&nbsp;to an off-site       long-term storage facility. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The encryption of the       client’s information is retained whenever backups are performed. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>PASconcept has       implemented routines for restoring backed up data. </p>
  </li>
</ul>
